Welcome to Skynet.  The Pillar Technology Skynet Machine Learning Group is an internal learning group within Pillar for artisans interested in (Statistical) Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

These pages are intended to serve as a general place for important announcements as well as the capturing of useful information about our group, AI/ML, and our projects.  Of particular use will be the [Resources]({{ site.github.url }}/resources/) page, which contains links to team resources and communication channels.
