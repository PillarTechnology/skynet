# Stand-up
Stand-up occurs as an informal, asynchronous update twice per week on the [Skynet slack channel](https://pillartechnology.slack.com/messages/skynet/).

* **You're expected to provide your stand-up update on the slack channel before Noon ET on Mondays and Thursdays**, so that you can then coordinate with anyone else who is in similar areas of the code as you or is doing something interesting or related to what you are doing.  (If you got nothing done or have no time to work on stuff at the moment, just say as much for your update, but make sure to keep up with what others are working on.)
* This should help reduce conflicts with client stand-ups and other client work.
