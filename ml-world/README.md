ML "World"
--

The idea behind the new project is to have a simple platform that will lend itself to extension and addition of AI and ML.

For those who have ever played with a MUD or MOO before, that's the basic starting idea -- build a simple, interactive platform that we can glom pieces onto.  I'm not suggesting that we actually write a fully-featured MUD or MOO.  Rather, that we have a blank slate of a "world" to interact with.  From there, we can create whatever we want.  For example:
- Mobs (non-player entities) that move around and interact with players (pathing, goals, plans, scripts, decision trees, etc.)
- Rooms containing simulated games (checkers, etc.) that can be played against an AI (searching, neural nets, rules, etc.)
- Rooms containing simulations of different kinds of things (traffic simulations, ants, etc.) (using agent based simulation, monte carlo simulation, etc.)
- Data can be collected over time based on interactions with users, simulations, etc. and can later be used for things such as improving user experience, better predicting user actions (so they can be countered by mobs, etc.), etc.
- A simple interface to the "world"
  - For example, a slack bot

The goal is to explore, play, and learn.  Take the "world" in whatever direction you want to.
